Hello and welcome to my little digital corner of the universe where I try to document what happens in my professional career. Here you will find a blend of my academic projects and publications as well as my professional CPD and the "probably more interesting" whacky and out-there projects and blogs about my wider passions. This is a curated peek into my life, so whether you are here on business, just curious or stumbled onto my page by accident, stick around and explore. Who knows? You might just find what you didn’t know you were looking for. Welcome to *Me*—online edition.


About Me
======
------

Originally from Northamptonshire, I moved to Manchester in 2018 to pursue a Master's Degree in Mechatronic Engineering with Industrial Placement at the University of Manchester. During this time I took a placement year as a robotics engineer with [WAAM3D](www.waam3d.com) developing skills in Automation, PLC Development, Industrial Robotics, Welding and Additive Manufacturing. I later graduated from the University of Manchester with Honours in 2023.


I am currently a 2<sup>nd</sup> Post Graduate Researcher in Robotics within the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [The University of Manchester](www.manchester.ac.uk), Manchester, UK. I am currently situated as a researcher within the Centre for Robotic Autonomy in Demanding and Long-lasting Environments, CRADLE. 

Alongside my academic career, I jump at every opportunity to volunteer and give back to the community. Over the past couple of years, I have been a part of many outreach activities as well as led several events delivering and teaching robotics to year 6-8 students from schools in the manchester area.
