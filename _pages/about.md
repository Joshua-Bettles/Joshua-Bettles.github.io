Hello and welcome to my little digital corner of the universe where I try to document what happens in my professional career. Here you will find a blend of my academic projects and publications as well as my professional CPD and the "probably more interesting" whacky and out-there projects and blogs about my wider passions. This is a curated peek into my life, so whether you are here on business, just curious or stumbled onto my page by accident, stick around and explore. Who knows? You might just find what you didn’t know you were looking for. Welcome to Me—online edition.
